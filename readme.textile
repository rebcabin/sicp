h1. SICP video lectures

This repo contains clojure code that I created while watching the SICP video lectures.

The source files, deriv1.clj to deriv5.clj, follow the lectures on how to calculate the
derivative of mathematical functions. I think these code-examples are shown in lectures 3B and 4A.

The final version of the program, deriv5.clj, uses pattern matching and rule-based substitution to
calculate the derivative function.

The video lectures can be found here:
